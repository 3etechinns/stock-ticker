# Stock Ticker

StockTicker is a game which simulates buying and selling stocks in a stock market. An indeterminate number of stocks will see their per share value rise and fall, under the control of a game engine, the BCIT Stock Exchange (BSX).  

  - The webapp represents a stock brokerage active on the BSX.
  - The object of the game is for players to build as much equity (stocks and cash) as possible.

### Version
1.0.0 - Alpha

### Changelog
1.0.1 - Added: 
      - .htaccess
      - Base controller
      - Index view for Base

### Tech

Stock Ticker uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [CodeIgniter] - CodeIgniter is a powerful PHP framework with a very small footprint
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - an awesome Javascript library
